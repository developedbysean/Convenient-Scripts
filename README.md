# Convenient Scripts
 Generic versions of scripts I have written mostly for file organization and other tedious tasks

## downloadsort.py
sorts things in the download folder and moves file types to respective folders
replace the paths in the code to the ones on your system then run the script

## imgsort.py
sorts files by the year and months they were taken or created.
